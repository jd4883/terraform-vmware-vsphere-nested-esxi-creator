# terraform-vmware-vsphere-nested-esxi-creator
Nested ESXI Creation Module. Takes in parameters for a nested esxi host and creates 1 or more based on criteria. NOTE: this is a very early stages module and is not heavily developed yet, I would like to get variable documentation substantially more thorough as well as create some more clever options to assist administrators who wish to use this
